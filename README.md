<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

AfoHotel is an open source, design-focued and the coolest Python-based Hotel Management System on GitHub. Built with Python 3, Tkinter and MySQL, and initially created as a high school CS project, it comprises of all the necessary Hotel Management **features** like:

-   Login 🔑 and Authentication through 🐬 MySQL database 😍
-   The ability to add, update, view and delete new records for:
    -   🔐 Rooms,
    -   💁 Guests, and
    -   ⏰ Reservations
- Secret Storage 👮 and handling using 💻 environment variables

This project was created as a proof that ancient frameworks like Tkinter could be used to create impressive applications with beautiful user interfaces.

<!-- Motivation -->

## Motivation

This project was created as a 5th grade BTS Project. Extra efforts were put in to make it stand out among others' projects, and since it was never meant to be used in real life, practicality was not the top most concern.

<details>
    <summary>More info...</summary>
    <p>As per CBSE (the Central Education Board) in India, students with Informatics Practices as a subject need to show their knowledge of Python and MySQL by creating an application that gets evaluated at the end of the year by an examiner/teacher from other schools, and hence the final grades for high school are determined. So, the application was a culmination of team effort, endurance and dedication of our duo. You could see through the commit history, where we started, how it stagnated and then we got the project where it is today.</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

-   Python 3 - [Download instructions here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   Pip 3 (usually gets installed automatically with Python)
-   MySQL Server - If you haven't already, [download the package from here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), then create a user account and note the username and password

If all the above are satisfied, you may proceed to the next section.

## Installation 

Follow these insturctions to setup your own instance of the app:

(**<u>PS</u>**: The instructions may look lenghty, but they;re simple and just explained in detail, so please don't click away. I would highly recommend you having a look at the codebase and trying the app for yourself.)

### 1: Clone the repo

Find instructions for [cloning/downloading this repo here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), then unzip the repository

Or if you have git command line installed, clone using this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Just-Moh-it/AfoHotel.git
```

### 2: Cd to the folder

Open terminal/cmd/powershell and change directory/folder to the cloned folder. [Here are the instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/)

The command for the same would be

```sh
cd Location\ To/AfoHotel
```

### 3: Install the PIP packages/dependencies

After you cd into the repo folder, ensure you see the following cmd/terminal prompt

```sh
Something.../AfoHotel $
```

If not, repeat the previous step.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4: Setup the database

To create the database from the MySQL schema, either:

1: Copy-paste the contents of [sql/hms.sql](sql/hms.sql) directly into the MySQL command line, or

2: Use the command to do it automatically (from cmd)

```sh
mysql -u <mysql-username> -p<mysql-password> < hms.sql
```

This will create and setup the database.

(**<u>Note</u>**: Don't **include the "<>" angular brackets** in the command, and replace the `<mysql-username>` and `<mysql-password>` with the credentials created, as discussed in the [Prerequisites Section](#Prerequisites))

### 5: Add database credentials to the app

Start by renaming the `.example.env` file just `.env`, and then replacing the `Your-Username` and `Your-Password` values with the MySQL credentials.

### 6: Installing Fonts

In order to make the app's gui look good, you will have to install the Montserrat font. From the `assets` folder, install all three fonts (with `.ttf` format) by double clicking them.

### 7: It's done 🎉 | Run the app

Run `main.py` file with python 3 and you should see the login window, if you have followed each step correctly.

The default username and password are `username` and `password` respectively.

If your app does not run properly, or gives an error, research about it until you find the solution, or else [create an issue here](https://github.com/Just-Moh-it/AfoHotel/issues/new). Someone will troubleshoot the issue.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Extras

Here are some things you may try with the app

### Adding new users

To add new login credentials, you will have to create new users by directly adding records to the database in the `login` table. Run the command to insert new login credentials:

```sql
INSERT INTO login (username, password) values ("your-username", "your-password");
```

(**<u>PS</u>**: This is the only part of the app that requires direct database interactions, since you can't add a signup page to an admin-based application without compromising on security, though our previous app versions had the feature, along with reset and forget password.)
